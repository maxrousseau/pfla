rewriting pfla

The new version of pfla will no longer automatically conduct statistical
analyses on the groups. The reason for this is that I aim to make the program
more simple, flexible and modular. These statistical analyses can easily be
performed after the images have been processed. This program will be solely
focused on the processing of facial image to produce data which can be used for
scientific purposes.

1. Making pfla pure python

I need to reimplement these R algorithms which i was reliant on
- procusteGPA
- mean shape

2. Updating algorithms

Add MTCNN facial detection and pytorch facial analysis

3. Simplifying use

cli: pfla [options]

-a analysis [detect=bounding box faces,
	landmarks=landmarks of faces,
	proc=procrusteGPA of groups,
	mean=mean shape of groups,
	metrics=all facial metrics/ratios computed]
-i single image(s) [string of file names separated by comma]
-d directory(ies) [string of directory paths separated by comma]
-s save output [out file: results.txt]
