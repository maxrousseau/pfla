rewriting pfla

The new version of pfla will no longer automatically conduct statistical
analyses on the groups. The reason for this is that I aim to make the program
more simple, flexible and modular. These statistical analyses can easily be
performed after the images have been processed. This program will be solely
focused on the processing of facial image to produce data which can be used for
scientific purposes.

GPA will not be supported anymore.

1. Making pfla pure python

2. Updating algorithms

Add MTCNN facial detection and pytorch facial analysis

3. Simplifying use (cli)

>pfla [options]
>	-a analysis [detect=bounding box faces,
>		landmarks=landmarks of faces,
>		metrics=all facial metrics/ratios computed,
>		all=all of the above]
>	-i single image(s) [string of file names separated by comma]
>	-d directory(ies) [string of directory paths separated by comma]
>	-s save output [out file: results.txt]

4. Limit dependencies
- numpy
- pillow
- pytorch

**PROGRESS**

fcn rewrite
1. img_prep: image/dir path > np_image
	OK
2. face_detect: np_image > bounding box coordinate (np_array)
	OK
	(working MTCNN but with package, should be reimplemented)
3. annotate: np_image, box > landmarks (np)
	OK
	(working with face_alignment package, should be reimplemented
4. metrics: landmarks (np) > metrics (np)
	OK

**TODO LATER (model implementations)**
-> mtcnn.py or vggface.py
-> landmarkmodel.py (Face Annotation Network/FAN)
-> GPA/mean shape implementation
