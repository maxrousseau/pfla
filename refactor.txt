/*- rewriting pfla -*/

The new version of pfla will no longer automatically conduct statistical
analyses on the groups. The reason for this is that I aim to make the program
more simple, flexible and modular. These statistical analyses can easily be
performed after the images have been processed. This program will be solely
focused on the processing of facial image to produce data which can be used for
scientific purposes.

NOTE: resize input and make sure that colors are RGB formats supported: jpg,
png, bmp, tiff.

GPA not supported for now.

1. Making pfla pure python

2. Updating algorithms

Add MTCNN facial detection and pytorch facial analysis

3. Simplifying use (cli)

>pfla [options] (path)
>	-d detect
>	-l landmark
>	-m metrics
>	-o format output as csv [pipe to file: results.txt]

4. Limit dependencies
- numpy
- pillow
- pytorch


**TODO**
-> logging/verbose/%progress 
(model implementations)
	-> mtcnn.py
	-> landmarkmodel.py (Face Annotation Network/FAN)
	-> GPA/mean shape implementation
-> cli.py: -g grayscale (TODO)
-> tests
-> distutils setup
-> travis CI
